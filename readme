---------------------------[ How to use it ]----------------------------
It's very easy. Just use scan button to perform a device
discovery session . Select a bluetooth address in order to do service discovery
or security attack test. You can find trace of your activity with the reports 
button and in the status bar.

         I mistakenly left a helomoto binary in the tools directory! You have to recompile it according to your box.

I'd like to say "Thanks" to Davide del Vecchio (dante) and Luca "Ikki" Carettoni.
They both transfer to me a curiosity and a good point of view about bluetooth
tecnology.
